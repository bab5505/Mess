<p><i>Sequoiadendron giganteum</i>(giant sequoia; also known as giant redwood, Sierra redwood, Sierran redwood, California big tree, 
    Wellingtonia or simply big tree—a nickname also used by John Muir[3]) is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, 
    and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae, 
    together with Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood). Giant sequoia specimens are the 
    most massive trees on Earth.[4] The common use of the name sequoia usually refers to Sequoiadendron giganteum, which occurs naturally 
    only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.</p>

    <p>Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world.[4] They grow to an average height of 50–85 m (164–279 ft) 
    with trunk diameters ranging from 6–8 m (20–26 ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8 m (311 ft) tall. Trunk diameters of 17 m (56 ft) 
    have been claimed via research figures taken out of context.[11] The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General 
    Grant tree at 8.8 m (28.9 ft).[12] Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters 
    than all known giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.[13] The trunks of coast redwoods 
    taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger diameters to greater heights.</p>
    
    <p>Trees may produce sprouts from their stumps subsequent to injury, until about 20 years old; however, shoots do not form on the stumps of mature 
    trees as they do on coast redwoods. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their boles when branches are lost to fire or breakage.</p>
    
    <p>A large tree may have as many as 11,000 cones. Cone production is greatest in the upper portion of the canopy. A mature giant sequoia disperses 
    an estimated 300–400 thousand seeds annually. The winged seeds may fly as far as 180 m (590 ft) from the parent tree.</p>
    
    <p>Lower branches die readily from being shaded, but trees younger than 100 years retain most of their dead branches. Trunks of mature trees in groves 
    are generally free of branches to a height of 20–50 m (70–160 ft), but solitary trees retain lower branches.</p>
    
    <h2>Distribution</h2>
    <hr>
    
    <p>The Generals Highway passes between giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park
    The natural distribution of giant sequoias is restricted to a limited area of the western Sierra Nevada, California. As a paleoendemic species,[17] 
    they occur in scattered groves, with a total of 81 groves (see list of sequoia groves for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only 144.16 
    km2 (35,620 acres). Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition. The northern two-thirds 
    of its range, from the American River in Placer County southward to the Kings River, has only eight disjunct groves. The remaining southern groves are 
    concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern Tulare County. Groves range in size from 12.4 km2 (3,100 acres) with 20,000 
    mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees. Many are protected in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and Giant Sequoia National Monument.</p>
    
    <p>High levels of reproduction are not necessary to maintain the present population levels. Few groves, however, have sufficient young trees to maintain the 
    present density of mature giant sequoias for the future. The majority of giant sequoia groves are currently undergoing a gradual decline in density since 
    European settlement.</p>
